        <h2>History</h2>
        <article>
            Rice is a staple in Japanese cuisine. Wheat and soybeans were introduced shortly after rice. All three act as staple 
            foods in Japanese cuisine today. At the end of the Kofun Period and beginning of the Asuka Period, Buddhism became 
            the official religion of the country. Therefore, eating meat and fish was prohibited. In 675 AD, Emperor Tenmu 
            prohibited the eating of horses, dogs, monkeys, and chickens. In the 8th and 9th centuries, many emperors 
            continued to prohibit killing many types of animals. The number of regulated meats increased significantly, 
            leading to the banning of all mammals except whale, which were categorized as fish. During this period, 
            chopsticks were introduced to Japan. Initially, they were only used by the nobility. The general population 
            used their hands, as utensils were quite expensive.
